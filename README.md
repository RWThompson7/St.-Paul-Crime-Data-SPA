This project is a single page application built using Vue.js framework, Nominatim and Leaflet APIs, as well as a custom API and SQLite3 database that allows users to view reported crimes within the neighborhoods in the St. Paul, Minnesota city limits. The page also allows for users to search for addresses or latitude and longitude and directly search the database through a number of different filters including dates, crime type, neighborhood, and more.
